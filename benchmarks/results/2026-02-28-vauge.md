# Benchmark Analysis Report (2026-02-28, Vague Prompt)

## Scope
Analysis compares the outcomes in:
- `benchmarks/benchmark-openspec/RESULT.md`
- `benchmarks/benchmark-simplespec/RESULT.md`

Benchmark setup:
- Frameworks compared: **SimpleSpec vs OpenSpec**
- Prompt input used for both runs: `benchmarks/VAGUE_FEATURE_REQUEST.md`
- Feature intent: add task deadlines and overdue discovery while keeping existing behavior and adding tests

## Executive Summary
Both runs successfully delivered the requested feature from the vague prompt.
- **SimpleSpec** produced stronger robustness and testing around invalid date handling.
- **OpenSpec** produced a simpler implementation with fewer guardrails.
- **SimpleSpec** remained materially more token-efficient than OpenSpec.

## Feature Outcome Assessment
### OpenSpec outcome
Implemented in `benchmarks/benchmark-openspec`:
- Added optional deadline on `Task`.
- Extended `createTask()` with optional deadline input.
- Added overdue API (`listOverdueTasks(now: string | Date)`).
- Added tests for deadline persistence and overdue filtering basics.
- Test result in log: **7/7 passing**.

### SimpleSpec outcome
Implemented in `benchmarks/benchmark-simplespec`:
- Added optional deadline on `Task`.
- Extended `createTask()` with optional deadline input.
- Added overdue API (`getOverdueTasks(referenceTime: Date = new Date())`).
- Added explicit invalid-date validation (deadline and reference time).
- Added tests for validation failures plus overdue semantics.
- Test result in log: **8/8 passing**.

## Quality Comparison (vague prompt context)
Because the prompt is intentionally vague, API naming/type choices can vary and still be correct.

### Correctness
- **Both** satisfy the user-level requirements.
- OpenSpec and SimpleSpec both support deadlines + overdue retrieval and preserve prior behavior.

### Robustness
- **SimpleSpec is stronger** due to explicit input validation and error tests for invalid dates.
- OpenSpec does not explicitly reject invalid `now`/deadline inputs.

### Test quality
- **SimpleSpec is stronger** for this run:
  - more edge-path coverage (invalid input cases),
  - clearer robustness assertions.
- OpenSpec tests cover core behavior but are less defensive.

## Rubric-Style Scoring
Using `benchmarks/QUALITY_RUBRIC.md` as reference:

### OpenSpec
- Correctness: **4.5/5**
- Test quality: **4.0/5**
- Code quality: **4.5/5**
- Robustness: **4.0/5**
- Weighted score: **4.3/5**

### SimpleSpec
- Correctness: **5.0/5**
- Test quality: **5.0/5**
- Code quality: **4.5/5**
- Robustness: **5.0/5**
- Weighted score: **4.9/5**

## Token / Context Efficiency
From benchmark logs:
- OpenSpec: context ~42.9k, up-tokens ~1.1m
- SimpleSpec: context ~27.5k, up-tokens ~348.2k

Estimated difference:
- SimpleSpec used approximately **68% fewer up-tokens** than OpenSpec in this vague-prompt benchmark.

## Notable Differences vs Detailed-Prompt Run
- Under a vague prompt, divergence increased in API details and validation strictness.
- SimpleSpec still delivered better defensive behavior without materially increasing complexity.
- OpenSpec completed successfully but with fewer safety checks and slightly weaker tests.

## Final Finding
For this vague-prompt benchmark, **both frameworks succeeded functionally**, but **SimpleSpec delivered the stronger overall outcome** (especially robustness/test quality) while also using substantially fewer tokens.
