## Why SimpleSpec?

Most AI coding workflows break down in the same place: **unclear intent**.

SimpleSpec gives you a lightweight, repeatable structure for defining what to build before generation starts. It helps your agent ship work that is:

- ✅ Aligned with your actual requirements
- ✅ Consistent across features and contributors
- ✅ Easier to review, test, and iterate

---

## What it does

SimpleSpec helps you:

- Create structured feature specifications
- Apply specs in a consistent implementation workflow
- Reduce ambiguity between product ideas and generated code
- Improve output quality from your AI runtime of choice

---

## Quick start

```bash
npx simplespec@latest
```

That’s it. Follow the guided flow and start building with clearer direction.

### Create a spec

Use this command as your core workflow:

**Create a new spec from an idea**
```text
/spec-new Build a task dashboard with filters, sorting, and bulk actions
```
This generates a structured spec under `.simplespec/specs/` with clear requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation tasks.

   > `/spec-new` will ask if you want to continue directly into implementation.

---

## Built for the AI era

SimpleSpec is designed for modern, agent-assisted development:

- Human-readable specs
- Repeatable execution patterns
- Better prompts through better structure

When your specs are clear, your code gets better.
